        <p>My name is Elise Danielle G. Abasolo. I am 15 years old currently studying in Antique National School. I am from Las-Pinas City but I am currrently living in Pis-anan, Sibalom, Antique. I finished my nursery and pre-school in Las-Pinas City and my Elementary Education here in Antique at Antique Integrated School.  I enjoy traveling to different places and go on adventures. One of my hobbies is creating/ doing art. By doing this, I can express my feeling and creativity without saying anything. I am not yet decided on what career I will pursue but I hope to be successful and achieve everything that I've been dreaming. </p>
