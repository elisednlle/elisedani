             <p>I grew up in a nuclear family, with my parents and siblings in one household. My family values love, responsibility, and most importantly our relationship with God.  We always make time for eachother, especially during important events for us to show that we care and value every success and achievement that we make. Our house is full of chaos but also filled with love and care. I am grateful to have them as my family.

<h2>My Mother</h2>
<p>My mother is a Teacher and a Businesswoman. She is very hardworking and is always willing to lend a hand to those who are in need. She also loves and adores plants. She sacrifices her own needs just to provide us everything that we need. Despite being tired from work, she still makes sure that her family is well taken care of. Her love is unconditional. I will always be grateful for everything that she has done for me.
