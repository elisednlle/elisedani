        <p>I finished my Pre-school Education at Headstart tutorial and learning house in Las-Pinas city. I dont remember much about this phase of my life but what I do know is I was always actively participating in school activities. I also sang a song during our completion ceremony. I made lots of friends and also brought my favorite stuffed toy with me even in school. </p>

     <p>I am now currently in highschool studying at Antique National School in the Special Program For the Arts. I am not really active in school activities but I try my best to be a part in some of them. I learned lots of things including lessons that I can carry until I grow old. I made new friends; people that fills my day with laughter and whom I can lean on when I have problems. They have been my buddies during school events, study sessions, or just random hangouts during we have vacant time. I am always grateful for having them as my friends and for being a part of my highschool journey. </p>
